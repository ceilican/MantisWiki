## Setup

For tests we set up 10 EC2 instances on a private network, we used genesis as bellow:
```
{
  "difficulty": "0x400",
  "extraData": "0x00",
  "gasLimit": "0x2fefd8",
  "nonce": "0x0000000000000042",
  "ommersHash": "0x1dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6ccd41ad312451b948a7413f0a142fd40d49347",
  "timestamp": "0x00",
  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "mixHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "alloc": {
    "d7a681378321f472adffb9fdded2712f677e0ba9": {"balance": "1606938044258990275541962092341162602522202993782792835301376"}
  }
}
```
for mining we used ethminer from `https://github.com/Genoil/cpp-ethereum.git` from branch `108` which supports CPU mining

we were testing on ubuntu 16.04, to compile ethminer you need to instal some packages:
```
sudo apt-get -y install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git cmake libcryptopp-dev libleveldb-dev libjsoncpp-dev libboost-all-dev libgmp-dev libreadline-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev ocl-icd-libopencl1 opencl-headers mesa-common-dev libmicrohttpd-dev build-essential -y
sudo apt-get install libjsonrpccpp-dev -y
```

We started ethminer with `ethminer -C -F 127.0.0.1:8546` and ours client with `sbt -Dconfig.file=/home/ubuntu/node.conf run`



## Testing
Firstly we run nodes not connected to each other, this way nodes got their own versions of blockchain after chains were ~60 blocks long we connected them together and let them mine and resolve conflicting branches at the same time.

We let them run for 3 days and after checking did not notice any error in logs, nodes are roughly on the same block and they are mining without any issue.

We also checked that we produced blocks with correct ommer.

After that we connected geth classic node and it was able to join network and sync chain from genesis to current block (it was configured for same private network)
