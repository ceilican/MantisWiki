_The purpose of this page is to keep track of all the blocks that failed to execute while we were working on TX execution. This is just a history of problems and fixes. It should help us deal with possible regressions and provide more insight into interpretations of YP._

A small bug in gas calculation for CALL prior to EIP-150 adoption. PR: [#160](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/160)

#### 179332

MSIZE was returning memory size to the exact byte, rather than rounded up to the next 32-byte word. PR: [#154](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/154)

The contract creating TX the payload was used as input data to the VM execution (it should be empty). PR: [#159]( https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/159)

Gas refunds were not propagated from recursive VM calls (CREATE, *CALL*). PR: [#158](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/158)

Wrong handling of deleted accounts. PR: [#150](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/150)

#### 68460

This was an example of YP being a little vague. It was not clear what was supposed to happen when the last stack argument (`outSize`) is greater than data returned from called contract. Now we know `outSize` should determine the memory size. See the the memory related equations in definition of `CALL`. PR: [#154](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/154)
