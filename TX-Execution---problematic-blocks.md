_The purpose of this page is to keep track of all the blocks that failed to execute while we were working on TX execution. This is just a history of problems and fixes. It should help us deal with possible regressions and provide more insight into interpretations of YP._

(Looks like errors are not propagated from a called contract to a calling parent contract

The stack arguments to instructions CALLDATALOAD, CALLDATACOPY, CODECOPY, EXTCODECOPY were optimistically/naively converted to `Int` resulting in potentially deadly overflows. PR [#169](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/169)

#### 505404
We used a wrong hash function for the precompiled contract @ 0x02. It should be SHA-256, not KEC-256 (SHA3). PR: [#168](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/168).

#### 299804

When calculating the gas cost of a CALL opcode, the use of UInt256 for it caused an overflow that resulted in the contract being executed instead of an OutOfGas exception. PR: [#167](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/167).


#### 244793

It's another manifestation of the problem that occurred in [block 68460](#68460). [#164](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/164)

#### 243826

When executing a contract init, the destination address might have already received funds. See YP EIP-150 REVISION eq (86).PR: [#162](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/162)

#### 196647

A small bug in gas calculation for CALL prior to EIP-150 adoption. PR: [#160](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/160)

#### 179332

MSIZE was returning memory size to the exact byte, rather than rounded up to the next 32-byte word. PR: [#154](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/154)

#### 153259

The contract creating TX the payload was used as input data to the VM execution (it should be empty). PR: [#159]( https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/159)

#### 81383

Gas refunds were not propagated from recursive VM calls (CREATE, *CALL*). PR: [#158](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/158)

#### 73276

Wrong handling of deleted accounts. PR: [#150](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/150)

#### 68460

~~This was an example of YP being a little vague. It was not clear what was supposed to happen when the last stack argument (`outSize`) is greater than data returned from called contract. Now we know `outSize` should determine the memory size. See the the memory related equations in definition of `CALL`. PR: [#154](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/154)~~

The above conclusion was incorrect (while the fix in PR #154 helped in this particular case). YP is actually clear about it, though somewhat inconsistent about updating memory contents vs expanding the memory. See equations for **_Î¼â€²<sub>m</sub>_** and **_Î¼â€²<sub>i</sub>_** in the CALL definition (this may be required to know the memory related gas cost a priori, although another way would be to refund it). PR: [#164](https://github.com/input-output-hk/etc-client/pull/164)

`SMOD` opCode was wrong

Logs were not discarded in the event of VM error

Gas refunds were not included in block's cumulative gas. This may be a bug in YP, see: https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper/issues/299
